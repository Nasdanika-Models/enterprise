There is some &ldquo;default&rdquo; channel delivering the semantic domain description. Views are delivered via the default channels and are not considered messages because they don&rsquo;t have a sender recipient. Any views exchanged between stakeholders via a non-default channel are messages.

I.e. the receiving stakholder(s) fully understand the intent of the sender stakholder(s). This function is highly dependent on the structure of the enterprise.

More precisely, &ldquo;an area of meaning and the words used to talk about it &hellip;&rdquo;1 In this model the above definition is divided into: Semantic Domain Kind - the metamodel. For example, Book Class (Kind) contains Chapter Class (Kind). Another example is the Family Model Semantic Domain - the model, instances of classes/kinds. For example Beyond Diagrams book contains &ldquo;Terminology (Semantic Domain)&rdquo; chapter. An enterprise operates on one or more semantic domains. E.g. an author writes one or more books. Sample Family is a semantic domain of Family semantic domain kind. &ldquo;Kind&rdquo; is one of the terms which cause confusion. A synonym for Kind is &ldquo;Type&rdquo;, or &ldquo;Class&rdquo; in languages like Java, or (maybe), &ldquo;Prototype&rdquo; in languages like JavaScript. One way to think about is an empty paper or web form. A form for a person would have fields for &ldquo;First name&rdquo;, &ldquo;Last name&rdquo; and &ldquo;Date of birth&rdquo; with no values. An instance of a kind/type/class/prototype is a filled-out form with, say &ldquo;John&rdquo; for the first name and &ldquo;Smith&rdquo; for the last name.

And maybe she hopes that he wouldn&rsquo;t catch anything, so she doesn&rsquo;t have to clean the fish and the eat it - she might prefer chicken or beef. Both of them are stakeholders.

Channels can transform/enrich and aggregate messages. Channels can be: Synchronous or asynchronous. Texting and e-mail are asynchronous. Phone and video are synchronous. Pushing or polling. Calling all your friends and telling them that you caught a fish is pushing. When your friends ask you about your fishing trip is polling. Unidirectional or bidirectional Delivering to a single recipient or multiple recipients For example, a book might be considered as a message addressing potential readers&rsquo; concerns. It is delivered over the publisher channel (LeanPub, Amazon), which is: Asynchronous, Polling, Might be bidirectional if readers can contact the author, Delivers to multiple recipients, Aggregates chapters with each chapter being a message on its own adressing specific readers&rsquo; concerns, Transforms the book to multiple formats (PDF, EPUB, Web). Examples This section contains examples of channels in a software development enterprise consisting of human and automation stakeholders. While it might be argued that an automation stakeholder is a resource, we&rsquo;ll consider it as a stakholder because it can receive messages and act on them including sending other messages. Version control system Version control systems like Git (GitHub, GitLab) can be considered a distributed event store and stream-processing platform similar to Apache Kafka. Commit is an event/message, branches are streams of commits. Both humans and automated agents may receive messages by polling (pull) or pushing (web hooks). Sample scenario: A developer commits a new Java file An automated AI assistant Inspects the new file Generates JUnit test cases and JavaDoc comments Commits them to a new branch Creates a merge/pull request assigning it to the developer who committed the file The developer Reviews proposed generated changes Makes necessary adjustments Merges changes There are two demos of the above scenario - retrieving sources from GitLab, generating a test case using OpenAI, committing generated code and creating a merge request: TestGitLab - all functionality is implemented in a single test method with 80 lines of code leveraging Nasdanika Java Model with Nasdanika GitLab Model&rsquo;s GitLabURIHandler to transparently load and parse Java files, and gitlab4j-api to commit generated sources and create a merge request. TestAnalyzers.testTheoryBuilder() and ReflectiveInspectors.untestedMethodInspector() implement the same functionality using Nasdanika Rules to separate loading, inspection, and commit/merge request concerns. Version control system can be also used to pass &ldquo;messsages&rdquo; - files - to a web browser. Examples: GitHub Pages jsDelivr for GitHub Issue management system An issue tracking system like GitHub issues or Jira may also be considered as a channel with issues being messages. In the above example, an automated AI assistant may: Create an issue to merge generated code Attach generated source code to the issue instead of creating a branch and a merge/pull request Or establish a link between the issue and the branch or merge/pull request Asssign the issue to the same developer Add the issue to the backlog or to the next/current sprint Link the issue to a parent issue (epic/initiative) which tracks progress of addressing technical debt In the above example there are multiple recipients of the message (issue): Developer - responsible, needs to address the issue by merging code Scrum master - accountable, ensures that the merge is performed by the developer Leadership - informed via dashboards or other means about the level of code coverage and amount of effort spent on addressing technical debt. An example of message aggregation. Maven repository A Maven repository can be used to pass generated documentation &ldquo;messaages&rdquo; to development environments such as Eclipse and web browsers using solutions like https://javadoc.io/ as an intermediary channel. P2 repository P2 repositories can be used to deliver integrated documentation &ldquo;messages&rdquo; - bundles/plugins - to Eclipse IDE including Eclipse Help System server."},"references/eClassifiers/RepresentationKind/index.html":{"link-uuid":"762676f9-ca9a-47d3-b7ac-5022287dc7c2","title":"Representation Kind","content":"A specification of the conventions for a particular kind/type/class of representation.
