That entity might be a person, organization, automated agent. Parties participating in the enterprise are stakeholders by definition - they have an interest in achieving the mission. For example, a guy goes fishing. His wife is interested whether he catches anything because it affects what she&rsquo;d need to cook for dinner. And maybe she hopes that he wouldn&rsquo;t catch anything, so she doesn&rsquo;t have to clean the fish and the eat it - she might prefer chicken or beef. Both of them are stakeholders. The guy is a single-stakeholder enterprise - so he is both an enterprise with a mission to catch fish and a participating stakehodler with an interest to catch fish. This enterprise also has resources - fishing rods, bait, boat, &hellip; The wife is a stakeholder as well, although she is not involved into the enterprise operations - buying bait, fueling the boat, catching fish, &hellip; To achieve the enterprise mission stakeholders separate concerns and collaborate by exchanging messages over communication channels. Even a single stakeholder may have multiple concerns and send messages to self over different channels. For example, create a shopping list (message) in a mobile application (channel) and a TODO list (message) in a paper planner (channel)."},"references/eClassifiers/Message/inheritance.html":{"path":"Message/Inheritance","action-uuid":"ca2fb7b9-1879-4421-b23d-68123a23c520","title":"Inheritance","content":"Supertypes "},"references/eClassifiers/Enterprise/index.html":{"action-uuid":"0b537539-b26f-4df8-a208-ce4a7c02c4b5","title":"Enterprise","content":"One definition of an enterprise is &ldquo;A group of people and resources devoted to achieving a mission.&rdquo;1 We will use the term &ldquo;stakeholder&rdquo; instead of &ldquo;people&rdquo;. A stakeholder can be a person, an organization/another enterprise, or an automated agent, including AI agents. Note that an enterprise may have a single stakeholder. Going fishing alone or with friends is an enterprise. Writing this book is also an enterprise. An enterprise operates on one or more semantic domains. For example, the book domain - author, reader, publisher, book, chapter, &hellip; Enterprises can be nested and interrelated. A classic example is a company with departments depending on each other. This model does not reflect this aspect for brevity.
