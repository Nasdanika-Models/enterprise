I.e. the receiving stakholder(s) fully understand the intent of the sender stakholder(s). This function is highly dependent on the structure of the enterprise.

For example, Book Class (Kind) contains Chapter Class (Kind). Another example is the Family Model Semantic Domain - the model, instances of classes/kinds. For example Beyond Diagrams book contains &ldquo;Terminology (Semantic Domain)&rdquo; chapter. An enterprise operates on one or more semantic domains. E.g. an author writes one or more books. Sample Family is a semantic domain of Family semantic domain kind. &ldquo;Kind&rdquo; is one of the terms which cause confusion. A synonym for Kind is &ldquo;Type&rdquo;, or &ldquo;Class&rdquo; in languages like Java, or (maybe), &ldquo;Prototype&rdquo; in languages like JavaScript. One way to think about is an empty paper or web form. A form for a person would have fields for &ldquo;First name&rdquo;, &ldquo;Last name&rdquo; and &ldquo;Date of birth&rdquo; with no values. An instance of a kind/type/class/prototype is a filled-out form with, say &ldquo;John&rdquo; for the first name and &ldquo;Smith&rdquo; for the last name.

And maybe she hopes that he wouldn&rsquo;t catch anything, so she doesn&rsquo;t have to clean the fish and the eat it - she might prefer chicken or beef. Both of them are stakeholders. The guy is a single-stakeholder enterprise - so he is both an enterprise with a mission to catch fish and a participating stakehodler with an interest to catch fish. This enterprise also has resources - fishing rods, bait, boat, &hellip; The wife is a stakeholder as well, although she is not involved into the enterprise operations - buying bait, fueling the boat, catching fish, &hellip; To achieve the enterprise mission stakeholders separate concerns and collaborate by exchanging messages over communication channels.

    "content": "Channel is something that passes messages between stakeholders. Channels can transform/enrich and aggregate messages. Channels can be: Synchronous or asynchronous. Texting and e-mail are asynchronous. Phone and video are synchronous. Pushing or polling. Calling all your friends and telling them that you caught a fish is pushing. When your friends ask you about your fishing trip is polling. Unidirectional or bidirectional Delivering to a single recipient or multiple recipients For example, a book might be considered as a message addressing potential readers&rsquo; concerns. It is delivered over the publisher channel (LeanPub, Amazon), which is: Asynchronous, Polling, Might be bidirectional if readers can contact the author, Delivers to multiple recipients, Aggregates chapters with each chapter being a message on its own adressing specific readers&rsquo; concerns, Transforms the book to multiple formats (PDF, EPUB, Web). Examples This section contains examples of channels in a software development enterprise consisting of human and automation stakeholders. While it might be argued that an automation stakeholder is a resource, we&rsquo;ll consider it as a stakholder because it can receive messages and act on them including sending other messages. Version control system Version control systems like Git (GitHub, GitLab) can be considered a distributed event store and stream-processing platform similar to Apache Kafka. Commit is an event/message, branches are streams of commits. Both humans and automated agents may receive messages by polling (pull) or pushing (web hooks). Sample scenario: A developer commits a new Java file An automated AI assistant Inspects the new file Generates JUnit test cases and JavaDoc comments Commits them to a new branch Creates a merge/pull request assigning it to the developer who committed the file The developer Reviews proposed generated changes Makes necessary adjustments Merges changes There are two demos of the above scenario - retrieving sources from GitLab, generating a test case using OpenAI, committing generated code and creating a merge request: TestGitLab - all functionality is implemented in a single test method with 80 lines of code leveraging Nasdanika Java Model with Nasdanika GitLab Model&rsquo;s GitLabURIHandler to transparently load and parse Java files, and gitlab4j-api to commit generated sources and create a merge request. TestAnalyzers.testTheoryBuilder() and ReflectiveInspectors.untestedMethodInspector() implement the same functionality using Nasdanika Rules to separate loading, inspection, and commit/merge request concerns. Version control system can be also used to pass &ldquo;messsages&rdquo; - files - to a web browser. Examples: GitHub Pages jsDelivr for GitHub Issue management system An issue tracking system like GitHub issues or Jira may also be considered as a channel with issues being messages. In the above example, an automated AI assistant may: Create an issue to merge generated code Attach generated source code to the issue instead of creating a branch and a merge/pull request Or establish a link between the issue and the branch or merge/pull request Asssign the issue to the same developer Add the issue to the backlog or to the next/current sprint Link the issue to a parent issue (epic/initiative) which tracks progress of addressing technical debt In the above example there are multiple recipients of the message (issue): Developer - responsible, needs to address the issue by merging code Scrum master - accountable, ensures that the merge is performed by the developer Leadership - informed via dashboards or other means about the level of code coverage and amount of effort spent on addressing technical debt. An example of message aggregation. Maven repository A Maven repository can be used to pass generated documentation &ldquo;messaages&rdquo; to development environments such as Eclipse and web browsers using solutions like https://javadoc.io/ as an intermediary channel. P2 repository P2 repositories can be used to deliver integrated documentation &ldquo;messages&rdquo; - bundles/plugins - to Eclipse IDE including Eclipse Help System server."
